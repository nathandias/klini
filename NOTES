- install ispring software on wordparts.nathandias.com
see what I can do with an iframe

- investigate free web hosting through https://www.000webhost.com/
Report: free PHP hosting with some execution limits, no SSH access, no emails, no subdomains- try installing web app on heroku

- try installing the web app on heroku


What we need from the webhost:

SSL - for sending secure passwords
PHP execution
ability to host a subdomain:
- main site www.wordparts.net and wordparts.net will be served by AllProWebTools
- the web application (student records) students.wordparts.net/ispring/ will be served by (Dreamhost / 000webhost.com / heroku)
- links on the main site will point to the app at students.wordparts.net


Nice to have:
SSH/SFTP/Shell access -- to make it easier to install and edit files securely


ADVICE:
I would recommend purchasing a basic shared web hosting account from a provider like Dreamhost.com, GoDaddy.com, Hostinger.com, Hostgator.com.
Purchase an account that allows for at least 1 website/domain and includes a free SSL certificate for encryption and security. The host has
to support PHP code execution...the above should work. An account that supports SSH/SFTP is also recommended for easier secure developer access to the site.

Note: the providers have introductory offers at $1 - $3/mo, however, these bump up to about $7-13/mo after the initial period, so be ready for
costs as much as $150/year after the initial period.

Optional:
- consider an unlimited shared hosting plan if you expect to host more websites in the future
- consider whether you will want to host Wordpress sites on the chosen web host, now or in the future and purchase accordingly
- "managed WordPress hosting" may not be sufficient...these accounts are designed specifically for WordPress hosting, and may not support PHP code execution (which we need)
- however, some shared hosting plans that will work, do offer 1-click WordPress installs and higher performance servers that *also* are optimized for WordPress..these are okay


000webhost.com
- 000webhost.com (NOT RECOMMENDED) FREE, but no SSL, no domains or subdomains, no SSH/SFTP access (only FTP) so may be extra work to install the codebase
- heroku (NOT RECOMMENDED): offers a free tier, but more technical knowledge to get a web app up and running vs. one of the simple shared hosting providers


Dreamhost:
- pros: I'm very familiar with it and can get it up and running more quickly / cons: might be a little more expensive
$2.59/mo x 3 years = $94. Renews at $6/mo. Includes 1 website with SSL certificate and SSH.
$3.95/mo x 3 years = $142. Renews at $11/mo. Includes unlimited websites with SSL certificate and SSH.


Hostinger:
Less familiar, but should work.
- Premium Shared Hosting - $2.59/mo x 48 mo = $125. renews at $7/mo after that. Includes unlimited websites, FREE SSL certificate (although landing page says otherwise), SSH access
